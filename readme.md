<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Introducing the ultimate framework for building high-quality Discord bots quickly and efficiently. Say goodbye to the tedious task of building a bot from scratch and focus on creating something truly amazing. This framework is designed to implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles (like command handler, event handler, etc), allowing you to spend more time creating and less time doing repetitive tasks.

With this framework, you can easily create a feature-rich bot that solves a problem and helps others. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, this framework is perfect for anyone looking to build a bot with minimal effort and maximum results.

The framework is constantly evolving, with new features and updates being added on a regular basis. You can also suggest changes and contribute to the development of the framework by forking the repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the contributors who have helped expand this framework!

To get started, simply visit the quickstart guide at [docs.zumito.ga/docs/custom/quickstart](https://docs.zumito.dev/guides/start/) and start building your bot today!
